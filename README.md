WHAT IS CLICK ME 

The click me is a memory game and it tracks the score, losses, and highest score. 

GETTING STARTED 

This application renders images to the screen and once the user clicks on an image the images sort to a random new position. 

If the user manages to click on all twelve images only once, the game is won, the highest score is tracked, and the game restarts. If the user clicks twice or more on the same image the game is lost and restarts.
